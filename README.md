Kao- communication
Kenya-asking for help
Yaz- time management

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
by talking it out and taking a few minutes to give each member a chance to ask questions.

Conflict Plan
Conflict resolution is essential for a successful team agreement plan. This plan outlines strategies to address and resolve conflicts within the team, creating an environment of collaboration and understanding.
1. Communicate Openly: The first step to handling conflict in a group is to encourage open communication. Everyone should feel comfortable talking openly and honestly about their thoughts and feelings on the issue.
2. Respect Each Other: It’s important to remember to respect each other’s opinions, even if you don’t agree. Everyone should feel heard and respected.
3. Find Common Ground: When it comes to resolving conflict, it’s important to look for areas of agreement. Find common ground and build on it.
4. Listen and Acknowledge: Listening and acknowledging each other’s viewpoints is key to resolving conflict. This will help each person feel heard and understood.
5. Come to a Resolution: Once everyone has had their say, it’s time to come to a resolution. Brainstorm potential solutions and agree on the best one.
6. Follow Through: Once a resolution is agreed upon, everyone should commit to following through on it. This will help ensure that the conflict is resolved and won’t resurface.
7. Use Mediator: If conflict cannot be resolved within the team, we will use the instructor as mediator.
